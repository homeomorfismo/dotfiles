# Dotfiles

See [this nice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6XCebnB9gs).

## Requirements 

We require `git` and `stow`. If using Mac, use `brew`.

Clone/fork/shallow-clone this repo and do `stow .`.

## Vim/Neo-vim

You can either build [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) from scratch.
I prever [neo-vim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), as the setting and some small search features are superior.
Nothing you can't improve with pluggins.

### Vim

Check [this tutotial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vimrc-configuration-guide-customize-your-vim-editor/) for 
more details on how to modify `.vimrc`.

### Neo-vim

The structure of Neo-vim is far more complicated but also more clean.
It is based on Lua. See [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9yqSdvAKXY&pp=ygUKbmVvdmltIGx1YQ%3D%3D).

## Git

The .gitconfig is simple, but *who doesn't like instant ramen?*

## Nerd Fonts

I am trying to make this a submodule!
