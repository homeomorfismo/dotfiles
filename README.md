# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles for my MacOS and Linux systems.

## Helix and Neovim

I prefer [neo-vim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), 
as the setting and some small search features are superior.
Nothing you can't improve with plugins.
I also use [Helix](https://helix-editor.com) as it doesn't
have a plugin system: forced minimalism.

## Git

The .gitconfig is simple, but _who doesn't like instant ramen?_

- Please, look `git adog`. It means _all branches, decorate, one-line, graphic_.
- I implemented similar aliases: `git dog`, `git dg`

## TODOs

- [ ] Make a submodule for Nerdfonts...
- [ ] Write recovery scripts for:
    - [ ] MacOS
    - [ ] Arch Linux (`pacman` and `yay`)
    - [ ] `apt` based distros
